# Gig Guide react native app expo

City of Melbourne is home of one of the worlds most thriving music scenes. I am keen to explore ways to help better equip musicians, venues and punters thought mobile application. 

The aim of this project, is to explore a basic landing page layout and screens as a public user. This project uses react-native-expo, Redux, react navigation and uses dummy data (no database)

Result: Redux state management is used to hold the clients ‘favorites” and “filter settings” to dummy data. The aesthetics are reasonable, however the react-native expo handling stack navigation looks unwieldy.
